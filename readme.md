<h3 align="center">Jabeda - An open source minimal accounting application</h3>



## About

I have a small team for my works. SO that I think to make an application to manage their payments, cost, earnings etc.
Jabeda is very simple accounting application to manage a small team as like mine. I have made this with Laravel 5.5

The software provides well-maintained and easy-to-understand reports in order to help businesses to get the insights.

The hosted software allows businesses to keep their data safe on the cloud, which eradicates the need for further investments into local storage.

The cloud-based accounting software ensures that your business data is 100% secure and can only be accessed by authorized users.
